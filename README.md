List of useful mental models form Gabriel Weinberg, CEO and co-founder of Duck Duck Go


# Mental Models I Find Repeatedly Useful

A mental model is just a concept you can use to help try to explain things (e.g. Hanlon’s Razor
“never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness.”. There are tens of thousands of mental models, and every discipline has their own set that you can learn through coursework, mentorship, or first-hand experience.

There is a much smaller set of concepts, however, that come up repeatedly in day-to-day decision making, problem solving, and truth seeking. As Munger says, “80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly‑wise person.”

The numbers next to each mental model reflect the frequency with which they come up:

* Frequently (63 models)
* Occasionally (43 models)
* Rarely, though still repeatedly (83 models)

## Explaining

### 
### Hanlon’s Razor
“Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness.” 

### Fundamental Attribution Error
“the tendency for people to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics of the agent (character or intention), rather than external factors, in explaining another person’s behavior in a given situation.”

### Occam’s Razor
“Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.” (related: conjunction fallacy, overfitting, “when you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.”

### Cognitive Biases

### Proximate vs Root Cause
“A proximate cause is an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the ‘real’ reason something occurred.” (related: 5 whys
“to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question ‘Why?’)

### Confidence Interval
“Confidence intervals consist of a range of values (interval) that act as good estimates of the unknown population parameter; however, the interval computed from a particular sample does not necessarily include the true value of the parameter.” (related: error bar)

### Bayes’ Theorem
“Describes the probability of an event, based on conditions that might be related to the event. For example, suppose one is interested in whether a person has cancer, and knows the person’s age. If cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes’ theorem, information about the person’s age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer.” (related: base rate fallacy)

### Local vs Global Optimum
“A local optimum of an optimization problem is a solution that is optimal (either maximal or minimal) within a neighboring set of candidate solutions. This is in contrast to a global optimum, which is the optimal solution among all possible solutions, not just those in a particular neighborhood of values.”

“maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.”

### Black or White
“When two alternative states are presented as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.”

where the government sets future standards beyond what the current market can deliver, and the market pulls that technology into existence.; Radical Candor)

### Virtual Team
“A group of individuals who work across time, space and organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of communication technology.” At least in some circumstances, it is possible to have a completely virtual team. The downsides in lack of face-to-face communication can be outweighed by the upsides in sourcing from the entire world.

### Introversion vs Extraversion
“Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior. Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms.”

### IQ vs EQ
“IQ is a total score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence.” “EQ is the capacity of individuals to recognize their own, and other people’s emotions, to discriminate between different feelings and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior.”

### Consequence vs Conviction
“Where there is low consequence and you have very low confidence in your own opinion, you should absolutely delegate. And delegate completely, let people make mistakes and learn. On the other side, obviously where the consequences are dramatic and you have extremely high conviction that you are right, you actually can’t let your junior colleague make a mistake.”

### High-context vs Low-context Culture
“In a higher-context culture, many things are left unsaid, letting the culture explain. Words and word choice become very important in higher-context communication, since a few words can communicate a complex message very effectively to an in-group (but less effectively outside that group), while in a low-context culture, the communicator needs to be much more explicit and the value of a single word is less important.”

### Peter Principle
“The selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate’s performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and ‘managers rise to the level of their incompetence.’”

### Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
“Maslow used the terms ‘physiological’, ‘safety’, ‘belongingness’ and ‘love’, ‘esteem’, ‘self-actualization’, and ‘self-transcendence’ to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through… [though there is] little evidence for the ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all.”

### Zero Tolerance
“Strict punishment for infractions of a stated rule, with the intention of eliminating undesirable conduct.”

### Commandos vs Infantry vs Police
“Three distinct groups of people that define the lifetime of a company: Commandos, Infantry, and Police: Whether invading countries or markets, the first wave of troops to see battle are the commandos…Grouping offshore as the commandos do their work is the second wave of soldiers, the infantry…But there is still a need for a military presence in the territory they leave behind, which they have liberated. These third-wave troops hate change. They aren’t troops at all but police.”

===

## Developing

### Technical Debt
“A concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.”

### Binary Search
“A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

### Moore’s Law
“The observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.”

### Metcalfe’s Law
“The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system…Within the context of social networks, many, including Metcalfe himself, have proposed modified models using (n × log n) proportionality rather than n^2 proportionality.”

### Clarke’s Third Law
“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

### Capital Allocation Options
“Five capital allocation choices CEOs have: 1) invest in existing operations; 2) acquire other businesses; 3) issue dividends; 4) pay down debt; 5) repurchase stock.

### Open Platform vs Closed Platform
“A closed platform, walled garden or closed ecosystem is a software system where the carrier or service provider has control over applications, content, and media, and restricts convenient access to non-approved applications or content. This is in contrast to an open platform, where consumers generally have unrestricted access to applications, content, and much more.”

### Freemium
“a pricing strategy by which a product or service (typically a digital offering or application such as software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but money (premium) is charged for proprietary features, functionality, or virtual goods.” (related: “If you’re not paying for it, you’re the product.”; pay to play)

### Luck Surface Area
“When you do something you’re excited about you will naturally pull others into your orbit. And the more people with whom you share your passion, the more who will be pulled into your orbit.”

### Hunting Elephants vs Flies
“Salespeople sometimes refer to ‘elephants’, ‘deers’ and ‘rabbits’ when they talk about the first three categories of customers. To extend the metaphor to the 4th and 5th type of customer, let’s call them ‘mice” and “flies’. So how can you hunt 1,000 elephants, 10,000 deers, 100,000 rabbits, 1,000,000 mice or 10,000,000 flies?” (related: brontosaurus, whale, and microbe)

===

## Marketing

### Bullseye Framework
“With nineteen traction channels to consider, figuring out which one to focus on is tough. That’s why we’ve created a simple framework called Bullseye that will help you find the channel that will get you traction.”

### Technology Adoption Lifecycle
“Describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or “bell curve”. The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called ‘innovators’, followed by ‘early adopters’. Next come the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called ‘laggards’.” (related: S-curve, Crossing the Chasm, Installation Period vs Deployment Period)

### Jobs To Be Done

## Competing

### Supply and Demand
“An economic model of price determination in a market. It concludes that in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted.” (related: perfect competition; arbitrage

### Strategy vs Tactics
Sun Tzu: “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.”

### Sphere of Influence
“A spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural, economic, military, or political exclusivity, accommodating to the interests of powers outside the borders of the state that controls it.”

### Unknown Unknowns
“Known unknowns refers to ‘risks you are aware of, such as cancelled flights….’ Unknown unknowns are risks that ‘come from situations that are so out of this world that they never occur to you.’ (related: Cynefin framework)

### Switching Costs
